3. `cd machinelearningformedicine`
4. `pip install jupyter`
5. `pip install fastai`
6. `jupyter notebook`

## Classifying Metastatic Breast Cancer Tissue

In this workshop, we will train a deep neural network to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans (an on-going [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection)).

## Where to go next?

1. Fast.ai - [Practical deep learning for coders](https://course.fast.ai/). “Learn how to build state of the art models without needing graduate-level math — but also without dumbing anything down”. I would highly recommend this course, although they suggest having at least one year of python beforehand.
2. Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - Arguably the most popular machine learning course. It starts with the fundamentals, as opposed to the top down approach of Fast.ai
